# Lovense_App
Attempting to make a GUI ran application that interacts with and controls Lovense Toys based in their current model and functions using an API setup.


Goals:
    Make a Locally run Python executable Application implementing easy-to-use GUI.
    Use an automatic persistence setting that locally saves data onto your PC without the need to worry about re-applying setting changes over time.
